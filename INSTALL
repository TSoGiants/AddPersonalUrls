To upgrade an existing installation, replace the files with new ones. If you have customized it in any way, check the [[{{NAMESPACE}}:{{BASEPAGENAME}}#Release notes|release notes]] for instructions on configuration changes.

Even though this extension has been tested on MediaWiki 1.21 only, it is likely to work on slightly earlier versions as well.
